Self-reported data is not shareable, for access, please place enquiry with the authors of [Hintzen, N.T. et al. (2025) ‘Bias in Global Fishing Watch AIS data analyses results in overestimate of Northeast Atlantic pelagic fishing impact’, ICES Journal of Marine Science.](https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsaf033)  

The [PySeas library](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/pyseas/) is required to produce the plot. Tested with version 0.8.2.
