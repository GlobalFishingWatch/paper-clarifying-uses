# paper-clarifying-uses
This repository contains the script to generate the figure for paper Clarifying uses and misuses of Global Fishing Watch fishing data, in press. ICES Journal of Marine Science.

The script produces a comparison plot showing general model, trawler model, and self reported fishing for a vessel.

Self-reported data is not shareable, for access, please place enquiry with the authors of [Hintzen, N.T. et al. (2025) ‘Bias in Global Fishing Watch AIS data analyses results in overestimate of Northeast Atlantic pelagic fishing impact’, ICES Journal of Marine Science.](https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsaf033)  

The [PySeas library](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/pyseas/) is required to produce the plot. Tested using version 0.8.2.
